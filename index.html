               <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Dal%C3%AD">
                  <p>Dal&iacute; was a skilled draftsman, best known for the striking and bizarre images in his surrealist work. His painterly skills are often attributed to the influence of Renaissance masters. His best-known work, <em>The Persistence of Memory</em>, was completed in August 1931. Dal&iacute;â€™s expansive artistic r&eacute;pertoire included film, sculpture, and photography, in collaboration with a range of artists in a variety of media.</p>
